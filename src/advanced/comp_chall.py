# Rewrite the following code to use a list comprehension, instead of a for loop.
#
# Add your solution below the loop, so that the resulting list is printed out
# below output - that makes it easier to check that it's producing exactly
# the same list (and avoids entering the input text twice).

text = input("Please enter your text: ")

output = []
for x in text.split():
    output.append(len(x))
print(output)

# type your solution here:
output = [len(text1) for text1 in text.split()]
print(output)

# It could be useful to store the original words in the list, as well.
# The for loop would look like this (note the extra parentheses, so
# that we get tuples in the list):

output = []
for x in text.split():
    output.append((x, len(x)))
print(output)

# type the corresponding comprehension here:
output = [(text1, len(text1)) for text1 in text.split()]
print(output)

# In case it's not obvious, a list comprehension produces a list, but
# it doesn't have to be given a list to iterate over.
#
# You can use a list comprehension with any iterable type, so we'll
# write a comprehension to convert dimensions from inches to centimetres.
#
# Our dimensions will be represented by a tuple, for the length, width and height.
#
# There are 2.54 centimetres to 1 inch.

inch_measurement = (3, 8, 20)

cm_measurement = [2.54 * item for item in inch_measurement]
print(cm_measurement)


# Once you've got the correct values, change the code to produce a tuple, rather than a list.
cm_measurement = tuple(2.54 * item for item in inch_measurement)
print(cm_measurement)
